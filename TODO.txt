 Perfect! I've implemented a complete RAG system with OpenAI embeddings and Supabase Storage. Here's what's
  ready:

  âœ… Completed:

  1. Database Migration (20240309000000_setup_pgvector_embeddings.sql):
    - Enables pgvector extension
    - Creates document_chunks table with vector embeddings
    - Adds storage fields to course_materials table
    - Creates semantic search function match_document_chunks()
  2. Embedding Service (utils/embeddings.ts):
    - Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
    - Batch processing for efficiency
    - Query embedding generation
  3. Upload API (app/api/course-materials/upload/route.ts):
    - Uploads files to Supabase Storage bucket
    - Extracts text and chunks documents
    - Generates embeddings for all chunks
    - Stores in database with page numbers
  4. Search API (app/api/search-chunks/route.ts):
    - Semantic search using vector similarity
    - Returns top matching chunks with sources

  ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (for you to complete):

  1. In Supabase Dashboard:
    - Run the SQL migration (20240309000000_setup_pgvector_embeddings.sql)
    - Create Storage bucket named course-materials
    - Set up Storage policies (in the guide)
  2. Add to .env.local:
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key...
  3. Install OpenAI SDK:
  npm install openai
  4. Update chat API to use semantic search instead of loading all materials
